## Semantic Versioning

The versions of jcommons-lang are maintained with the Semantic Versioning guidelines.

Release version numbers will be incremented in the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

The only exception from the official guidelines are the following:

If the minor and patch version ends with a zero then the minor and the patch can be omitted.
 
For instance if the project version is '1.0.0' we will write '1'. So we omit the '.0.0'.

The same applies if only the patch version ends with a zero then the patch can be omitted.
 
For instance if the project version is '1.1.0' we will write '1.1'. So we omit the '.0'.
